# DOM-Drum-Kit
About This website was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other internet resources. It serves as a project for learning the concept of the Document Object Model (DOM) with JavaScript. Although it is a simple website, I thoroughly enjoyed creating it. If you encounter any issues with this project, please feel free to reach out to me.
